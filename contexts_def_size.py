'''
Group ImageNet classes into 18 'size contexts'.

Method:
1. Find the ImageNet classes with baseline accuracy within 1 standard deviation
    of the average accuracy.
2. From these, sample contexts (sets of classes) of size in [2^x for x = 0:9].
    These contexts can have common members.
3. Repeat sampling if the standard deviation of baseline accuracy across the
    contexts is greater than 2% (ensures contexts have approximately equal
    difficulty).
