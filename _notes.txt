repeat semcontexts with data augmentation
try perceptual similarity model
get flow_from_dataframe working
repeat sizecontexts with different contexts
try similarity measures with full covariances

remember to change back `datagen_train` in `training.py`

full covariance matrix takes too long to find, and distances are slower to
compute with full covariance.

frechet = wasserstein-2. wasserstein seems to be better than KL (see WGAN paper)
so not expecting KL to give better results than frechet.

mahalanobis_v3.py takes 20s/loop * 1000loops = 5.5hr
kl_divergence_v2.py takes 40s/loop * 1000loops = 11hr

similarities
- ssim: scikit-image, tensorflow etc
- kl, sym kl, js, mahalanobis, frechet: tensorflow etc
